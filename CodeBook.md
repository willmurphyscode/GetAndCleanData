# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Final Project CodeBook

The analysis, location at ~/results/Tidy.csv, can be re-generated
by executing run_analysis.R. The current version was developed
in R version 3.2.2 running in RStudio on Windows 7. 

The data were downloaded from this URL: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. 

Units: 
activity - character string, treated as factor, one of WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
participant - designation for the subject wearing the smart phone. Numbers 1 - 25
time_body_acceleration_mean_x - in standard gravity units, 'g', the mean x axis accelaration
time_body_acceleration_mean_y - in standard gravity units, 'g', the mean y axis accelaration
time_body_acceleration_mean_z - in standard gravity units, 'g', the mean z axis accelaration
time_body_acceleration_std_x - in standard gravity units, 'g', the mean of the original study's standard deviation of x axis accelaration
time_body_acceleration_std_y - in standard gravity units, 'g', the mean of the original study's standard deviation of y axis accelaration
time_body_acceleration_std_z - in standard gravity units, 'g', the mean of the original study's standard deviation of z axis accelaration
time_gravity_acceleration_mean_x
